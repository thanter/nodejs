NODE is written IN C++

BECAUSE

Node is based on the V8 engine,which is written in C++

V8 is Google's open source high-performance JavaScript engine, written in C++ and used in Chromium,
Node.js and multiple other embedding applications
V8 compiles and executes JavaScript source code.


JAVASCRIPT is the actual code we write.
ECMASCRIPT is the standard that explains how the language should work.
There are many JS engines with minor differences.

========== MOST IMPORTANTLY ==============
V8 can be embedded in other C++ applications!!!
And, in my application i can enhance/extend the functionality of JS with my additions.
(That's what nodejs does),
eg: deal with files and folders, talk to databases etc. C++ already knows how to do these things.
It's like im adding functionality coming from C++ to JS language.

Another example:
JS does not support the following code: print('hello'); (based on the ecmascript spec)

BUT

I can define a 'print' method inside my C++ little application which can call the 'print' method of C++
and it will do what i want it to do.

ACTUALLY, google chrome is another C++ application that extends (based on) V8 engine.
For example, the Ecmascript spec sais nothing about dom manipulation. But the browser adds
this functionality to the language.


Node does not only have the extended C++ core but it provides a variety of JS code/libs.
These libs are wrappers around the c++ functionality.
Easier for us to use.


!!!!!! What 'extras' does javascript need to manage a server? !!!!!!!!
- Better ways to organize our code, into reusable modules
- Ways to deal with files
- Ways to deal with DBs
- Communicate over the internet
- Accept requests and send responses
- Ability to deal with work that takes a long time.
